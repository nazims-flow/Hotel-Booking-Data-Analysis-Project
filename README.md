 Welcome to the Hotel Booking Data Analysis project! In this project, we explore and analyze a
 dataset containing hotel booking information to derive insights and patterns that can be useful
 for understanding booking trends, customer behavior, and other factors affecting the hospitality
 industry.
 ## Introduction
 This project focuses on analyzing a dataset obtained from hotel booking records, including
 information such as booking dates, hotel details, guest demographics, and reservation statuses.
 By leveraging SQL queries and data analysis techniques, we aim to answer various questions
 and uncover valuable insights from the dataset.
 ## Dataset Overview
 The dataset used in this project consists of 11931 rows of data, representing hotel
 bookings. Before analysis, the dataset underwent a data cleaning process to handle missing
 values (NULLs) and ensure data quality.

 ## Analysis Questions
 To guide our analysis, we formulated several key questions to explore and address using the
 dataset:
 ## Additional Analysis Questions
